# Enriching-KoLLA

A placeholder for the paper *Enriching the Korean learner corpus* by Jayoung, Kyungtae, and Jungyeul. 


We address this critical gap by enhancing the KoLLA Korean learner corpus, a foundational resource for Korean language education research. Our enhancements include the addition of multiple grammatical error correction (GEC) references, effectively transforming the dataset into a multi-reference GEC corpus. This multi-referential approach allows for more nuanced analysis and evaluation of grammatical error correction systems, accommodating the complexity and variability inherent in human language. Moreover, we enrich the dataset with rubric-based scores derived from the guidelines provided by the Korean National Language Institute. These rubric scores offer standardized measures of writing quality, capturing dimensions such as grammatical accuracy, coherence, and lexical diversity. By incorporating these scores, we make the KoLLA corpus not only robust and versatile but also suitable for use as a standardized evaluation benchmark for Korean L2 learning and assessment.
