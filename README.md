Despite the increasing interest in Korean language education and the growing population of Korean L2 learners worldwide, there remains a significant gap in the development of learner corpora specifically for Korean L2 writing. This gap arises from the limited availability of well-established datasets that are systematically designed to analyze L2 learner errors, linguistic patterns, and writing performance across diverse proficiency levels and contexts.
In this paper, we address this critical gap by enhancing the KoLLA Korean learner corpus, a foundational resource for Korean language education research. Our enhancements include the addition of multiple grammatical error correction (GEC) references, effectively transforming the dataset into a multi-reference GEC corpus. This multi-referential approach allows for more nuanced analysis and evaluation of grammatical error correction systems, accommodating the complexity and variability inherent in human language.
Moreover, we enrich the dataset with rubric-based scores derived from the guidelines provided by the Korean National Language Institute. These rubric scores offer standardized measures of writing quality, capturing dimensions such as grammatical accuracy, coherence, and lexical diversity. By incorporating these scores, we make the KoLLA corpus not only robust and versatile but also suitable for use as a standardized evaluation benchmark for Korean L2 learning and assessment.
These enhancements position the KoLLA corpus as a  resource for advancing research in language learning tools, pedagogical methodologies, and automated grammatical error correction. Ultimately, our work supports the broader goal of improving the quality of Korean language education for L2 learners across different educational and linguistic contexts.
